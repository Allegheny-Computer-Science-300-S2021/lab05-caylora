 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


 




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?




 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?




 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
